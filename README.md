# shellscripts
A shell script snippets repository website

Please do note that I'm experimenting with various web frameworks with this.

I'm kinda interested in sever-side rendering, so I think I'm gonna implement it,
but I can't find any applicable framework for that. Please let me know by
sending mail [here](mailto:yoo2001818@gmail.com) if you know one!
